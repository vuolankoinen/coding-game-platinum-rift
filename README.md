# Codingame Platinum Rift controller

This is my code to play the game on www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/platinum-rift-episode-1.  
At the moment it has beaten the Wood, Bronze and Silver leagues and has standing 107/300 in the Gold league.

The code is all contained in one file, because that's how the codingame-IDE requires the code to be written.

Platinum Rift is a turn-based resource-collecting war game played on map consisting of hexagonal tiles.  
Coding game site provides an interface to the game for users' programs: game states are provided as several lists of numbers and moves are read as two lines of output each turn from the user programs. Programs from the users (written in any of \~15 languages) are pitted against each other in series of games to rank them.
