This is my code to play the game on www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/platinum-rift-episode-1

Platinum Rift is a turn-based resource-collecting war game played on map consisting of hexagonal tiles.  
Coding game site provides an interface to the game for users' programs: game states are provided as several lists of numbers and moves are read as two lines of output each turn from the user programs. Programs from the users (written in any of \~15 languages) are pitted against each other in series of games to rank them.
